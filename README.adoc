= Zapp Gradle Plugin


A gradle plugin with common utilities for Zapp projects

== Functionality

The plugin provides a `zapp.requireDependency(mavenName, mavenVersion, projectName)` utility that will
use the dependency from the project if it exists or the maven dependency if it doesn't

TIP: The plugin is link:{gradle-plugins-portal}[available on the Gradle plugin portal] for public consumption.

== Usage example

The plugin can be applied with by identifier `gradle.zapp`.

IMPORTANT: The plugin requires a Gradle version of 4.0 or higher. All features that are based on Gradle 4.0 are explicitly
marked above. All other features will work with earlier versions of Gradle.

```
plugins {
    id("gradle.zapp")
}

dependencies {
    // This will use dependency from project "example-dependency" if it exists or maven otherwise.
    implementation zapp.mavenOrProject("com.applicaster:ExampleDependency", "1.0.0", "example-dependency")
}
```

== Applied techniques and practices

- Production and test code written in Kotlin.
- Usage of the Plugin Development plugin to simplify plugin development. [link:https://github.com/gradle-guides/gradle-site-plugin/blob/master/build.gradle.kts#L6[Code] | link:https://guides.gradle.org/implementing-gradle-plugins/#plugin-development-plugin[More Details]]
- Functional testing with TestKit. [link:https://github.com/gradle-guides/gradle-site-plugin/blob/master/src/intTest/kotlin/org/gradle/plugins/site/SitePluginFunctionalTest.kt[Code] | link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/test_kit.html[More Details]]
- Publication of the plugin artifacts to the Gradle plugin portal [link:https://github.com/gradle-guides/gradle-site-plugin/blob/master/build.gradle.kts#L136-L163[Code] | link:https://guides.gradle.org/publishing-plugins-to-gradle-plugin-portal/[More Details]]
- Continuous Integration of plugin code with Github Actions
- Automatic generation of build scans when build is executed from CI. [link:https://github.com/gradle-guides/gradle-site-plugin/blob/master/build.gradle.kts#L25-L33[Code] | link:https://scans.gradle.com/[More Details]]
